# Tweets-Classification-using-NLP

The following project is based on Sentiment analysis which is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helps a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.In this project I have implemented a sequence-based text classification model to predict the number of positive and negative reviews based on sentiments.
